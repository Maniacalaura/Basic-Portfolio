        <p class="paragraph">Hello! I'm Laura, I'm 32 and I'm from Salt Lake City. I love to learn new things. 
            I've studied Nursing, Graphic Design, Data Analysis, Broadcasting and even Physics! I have a 
            tendency to get bored with things and move on to something completely different every few years. 
            So this is my new thing for the next few years! Since coding is always growing, I don't think I'll 
            get bored! There is always something new to learn. I'm looking forward to adding coding to my list 
            of random things I know.    
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">I live in an adorable two-bed two-bath townhouse in Murray. I bought it as a 
            foreclosure and had to completely renovate it, it was stressful but fun. My roommate is my 10-year 
            old black lab, Kaiya. She's not a great roommate, she’s very messy and has terrible gas, but I love 
            her! I've had her since she was a puppy, she's always been nuts. She is great at being the mama dog 
            to the puppies I foster. I like to say she teaches them how to "dog".
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> I have worked in Radio for the past 5 years, and it's been a wild ride. There is 
            so much I love about radio; it is an incredibly fun and unique work experience. There aren't a lot 
            of workplaces that let you wear jeans and chucks, listen to loud music, meet artists, and go to 
            awesome concerts and events. It's so fun, but you can't be in it for the money because there isn’t 
            much of it.
